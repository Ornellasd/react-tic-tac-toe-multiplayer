# React Tic-Tac-Toe Multiplayer

This project is an implementation of the project in [this](https://dev.to/nilmadhabmondal/build-multiplayer-realtime-tic-tac-toe-game-with-socketio-and-vue-5clp) tutorial built in React instead of Vue. 

This was started to learn [socket.io](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io) in preparation for another project idea I have, and to practice what I've learned of React so far.
